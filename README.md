# CryptoStats - Android App

## Project Description
CryptoPortfolio is an Android application created for the purpose of learning Android app development. Users can input their cryptocurrency portfolios, and the app will display their real-time value. Data is fetched from the CoinMarketCap cryptocurrency exchange.

## Technologies
The application is developed using Java for the Android platform, and utilizes two libraries:

- **Picasso** - Allows for image loading within the app and network libraries
- **OkHttp** - HTTP client used for fetching data from CoinMarketCap

## Features
The app offers the following functionality:

1. **Add and Remove Cryptocurrencies** - Users can add or delete cryptocurrencies and specify their quantity, which allows for monitoring the value of individual portfolios and their combined value.
2. **Display Portfolio Value** - Users can input the total amount of each cryptocurrency they own, and the app will show this sum, the current value, the percentage change, and the total portfolio value (the sum of the value of all owned currencies).
